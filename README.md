# Level3

Shiny App to explore a scatterplot of tokens connected to a scatterplot of their context words.
This includes information on HDBSCAN clusters of the tokens and the representativity of the context words
in terms of these clusters.
It's a 'fancier' version of Level 3 of [this visualization](https://github.com/qlvl/NephoVis/).
See [here](https://cloudspotting.marianamontes.me/nephovis.html#shiny) for a brief illustration.

# How to use

Fork this repository, change the datasets in the "cloudspotting-medoids" subdirectory to your own data, adapt the variables in "R/variables.R" and [run the Shiny App](https://mastering-shiny.org/index.html).
